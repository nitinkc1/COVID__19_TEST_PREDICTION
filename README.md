   - Report characteristics of important features, including the total number and percentage of each category.

## Section 4: Machine Learning Approach

### Predictive Modeling

1. **Dataset Information:**
   - Utilize the "corona_tested_006" dataset from the 'ABC' government website.

2. **Model Training and Validation:**
   - Train and validate the model using data from 11th March 2020 to 15th April 2020, with a 4:1 ratio for training and validation.

3. **Test Set:**
   - Evaluate the model on data from 16th April 2020 to 30th April 2020.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Perform appropriate feature engineering tasks on the dataset.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use data visualization techniques to identify patterns in the data.

6. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implement multiple machine learning models relevant to the hypothesis.

7. **Cost Functions:**
   - Employ important cost functions to justify the superiority of the chosen model.

8. **Comparison of Models:**
   - Compare at least four models to determine the most effective for COVID-19 prediction.

## Machine Learning-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Symptoms

5. **Cough (True/False)**
6. **Fever (True/False)**
7. **Sore Throat (True/False)**
8. **Shortness of Breath (True/False)**
9. **Headache (True/False)**

#### C. Other Information:

10. **Known Contact with an Individual Confirmed to have COVID-19 (True/False)**

#### D. COVID Report:

11. **Corona Positive or Negative**

## Machine Learning Models

# The following machine learning models were employed for prediction:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Evaluation Metrics

  Each model was evaluated using precision, recall, and f1-score, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance. Additionally, the accuracy score was     
  computed to gauge the overall predictive capability.
  
## Results

# Here's a tabular representation of the above information:

```markdown
| Model                     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy Score |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Random Forest Classifier  |   0.00    |  0.47  |   0.00   |     0.9528     |
| Logistic Regression       |   0.00    |  0.59  |   0.00   |     0.9435     |
| Decision Tree Classifier  |   0.00    |  0.47  |   0.00   |     0.9528     |
| Support Vector Classifier  |   0.00    |  0.53  |   0.00   |     0.9392     |
